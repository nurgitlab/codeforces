## Motivation

During my career as a Senior developer, questions have been put in front of me about why to solve so many algorithmic problems, and what they can teach a Web developer.

If for large companies it is an input filter, the filling of which depends on the hiring processes (about it in the pro-life repository, I will add a link later), then for a developer we can emphasize the following bonuses:
shorter code, more productive solutions, shorter time to process any object.
